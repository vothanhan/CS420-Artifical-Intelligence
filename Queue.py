      Implements a priority queue data structure. Each inserted item
      has a priority associated with it and the client is usually interested
      in quick retrieval of the lowest-priority item in the queue. This
      data structure allows O(1) access to the lowest-priority item.

      Note that this PriorityQueue does not allow you to change the priority
      of an item.  However, you may insert the same item multiple times with
      different priorities.
